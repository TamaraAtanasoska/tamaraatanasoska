## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ«§ I currently work at [:probabl.](https://probabl.ai/), contributing to repositories like [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and [fairlearn](https://fairlearn.org/) as part of my job. Previously, I've worked at [Explosion](https://explosion.ai/), [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/en/) and a few others. 

ðŸ«§ A few years ago, for the everlasting love of language, I went back to Uni for a Master's degree. Taking part in the [Cogntive Systems](https://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/cogsys/) program was a blast and a dream come true. I got to explore (computational) linguistics and NLP, cognitive (neuro)science, ML and work on various research projects. I am still involved in supporting research in applied computational lingusitics.

ðŸ«§ I sometimes write on my [blog](https://www.holophrase.de/blog). A lot of the content is centred about language and literature. 

ðŸ«§ I am always interested in collaborating with institutions on scientific projects. Feel free to [contact me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tamaraatanasoska/) if you have an idea for a collaboration.
